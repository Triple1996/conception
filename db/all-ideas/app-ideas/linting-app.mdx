# Create a Linting App

## A cross-platform linting app that allows users to lint and formt their code 

It is an app where users can upload a file or directory of files to be formatted

The app will automate such processes as running python-Black, lint, Prettier, or any other code formatter/linter

Users can use a dropdown menu to select from a number of different styles or formats

The app will then enforce the chosen styles onto the files uploaded

If any errors or conflicts between styles occur, user will be prompted to choose one, similar to resolving a merge conflict
